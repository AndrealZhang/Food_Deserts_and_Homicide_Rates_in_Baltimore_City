# The Impact of Food Deserts on Homicide Rates in Baltimore City
Homicide has been linked to factors such as poverty and economic inequality. In 2019, there were [347 homicides in Baltimore](https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/31/americas/baltimore-2019-homicides/index.html), breaking the record for killings per capita. We wanted to analyze whether there are other significant variables more present in Baltimore that could lead to such a high homicide rate.

What are the socioeconomic factors that affect Baltimore’s high homicide rate, and what actions can the local government take?

After researching more about specific conditions in Baltimore, we found that [20% of Baltimore residents live in food deserts](https://www.umaryland.edu/gogreen/news/food/combating-the-urban-food-desert.php). A food desert is roughly defined as a location where there is no access to affordable nutritious foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Since a high population of Baltimore residents live in food deserts, we narrowed down our question:

Could food deserts be a cause of the high homicide rate in Baltimore?

We analyzed several other factors, including more common factors such as unemployment, for comparison.
### Finding
Higher % of area covered by food desert →  higher % of deaths due to homicide 
More Food Deserts →  More Unhealthy Foods/Less Healthy Foods →  More Aggression, Stress, And Anxiety → More Homicides 

### Suggestion
Government promotes programs that helps citizens afford healthy foods → citizens eat healtier → less aggression and stress → fewer homicides

# Significance
As mentioned earlier, homicides in Baltimore are a deadly problem that is getting worse every year. However, another problem goes undercovered: food deserts. As mentioned earlier, citizens in the food deserts cannot access healthy foods and are forced to consume more unhealthy food options at corner stores and carry out restaurants. Healthy diets are important because they help our bodies to [manage the psychological changes caused by stress](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/stress-diet-can-foods-help). On the other hand, [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/apr/24/can-food-make-you-angry) notes that greater trans fatty acids from unhealthy diets are associated with greater aggression and [ETIMES](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/diet/Junk-food-leads-to-anger-issues/articleshow/19946022.cms) corroborates that a nutrient deficiency leaves a person hyperactive towards a stressor. Thus, it is important to analyze the relationship between food deserts and homicide rates as if there are more food deserts, then there will be higher aggression caused by unhealthy diets, possibly leading to more homicides.




# Summary
1. FOOD DESERT: Higher average percentage of food desert in certain neighborhoods in Baltimore, higher average percentage of deaths due to homicide in those neighborhoods
2. UNEMPLOYMENT: Higher average of unemployment in certain neighborhoods in Baltimore, higher average percentage of deaths due to homicide in those neighborhoods
