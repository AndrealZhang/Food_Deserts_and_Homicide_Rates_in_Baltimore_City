# Background
Based on countless studies, homicide has been linked to factors such as poverty and economic inequality. Although the issue of homicides is not unique to any location, in 2019, there were [347 homicides in Baltimore](https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/31/americas/baltimore-2019-homicides/index.html), breaking the record for killings per capita. Since all cities across the nation have poverty and economic inequality, we wanted to analyze whether there are other significant variables more present in Baltimore that could lead to such a high homicide rate. This brings us to our business question:

What are the socioeconomic factors that affect Baltimoreâ€™s high homicide rate, and what actions can the local government take?

After researching more about Baltimore, we narrowed down our question:

Could food deserts be a cause of the high homicide rate in Baltimore?

# Data
We chose to analyze the [2017 Neighborhood Health Profile Data](https://health.baltimorecity.gov/neighborhoods/neighborhood-health-profile-reports) from the Baltimore City Health Department. It is comprehensive and contains data about major health outcomes for 55 Community Statistical Areas in the city of Baltimore. Although this data is from 2017, it is still relevant because Baltimore has a long history of high homicide rates. 

We looked at these factors: 
- Median household income <br>
Median annual household income, according to the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance
- % living below Federal Poverty Level <br>
Percentage of families that earned less than the Federal Poverty Level in the past 12 months
- % of Adults with Less than a HS Diploma <br>
Percentage of adults 25 years of age or older with less than a high school diploma
- % of Area Covered by Food Desert <br>
Percentage of land area covered by food desert, as defined by the Center for a Livable Future
- Vacant Lot Density <br>
Number of vacant lots per 10,000 housing units
- Unemployment <br>
Percentage of population 16 years of age or older in the labor force that are unemployed

Two factors of special interest are vacant lot density and percent of area covered by food desert.
## Vacant Lot Density
We were interested in looking at the number of vacant lots in different neighborhoods in Baltimore. Vacant lots are small areas of land that are not being occupied or used. It is usually neglected and, in many cases, houses were on these lots, but they fell into disrepair and were demolished. 

They disrupt a neighborhood's sense of community and lower property values. There are significantly more vacant lots in poorer neighborhoods, which could possibly contribute to higher homicide rates.
## Percent of Area Covered by Food Desert
The [Center for a Livable Future](https://clf.jhsph.edu/about-us/news/news-2012/new-improved-food-desert-map) defines food deserts: 
- An area where the distance to a supermarket is more than one quarter of a mile
- The median household income is at or below 185% of the Federal Poverty Level
- Over 40% of households have no vehicle available 

We were interested in this data because a food desert represents a location where resources are scarce and healthy habits are hard to maintain. This could possibly impact homicide rates in Baltimore.
