# Background
Based on countless studies, homicide has been linked to factors such as poverty and economic inequality. Although the issue of homicides is not unique to any location, in 2019, there were [347 homicides in Baltimore](https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/31/americas/baltimore-2019-homicides/index.html), breaking the record for killings per capita. Since all cities across the nation have poverty and economic inequality, we wanted to analyze whether there are other significant variables more present in Baltimore that could lead to such a high homicide rate. This brings us to our business question:

What are the socioeconomic factors that affect Baltimoreâ€™s high homicide rate, and what actions can the local government take?

After researching more about Baltimore, we narrowed down our question:
Could food deserts be a cause of the high homicide rate in Baltimore?

We chose to analyze the 2017 Neighborhood Health Profile Data from the Baltimore City Health Department. This data is extremely comprehensive and contains data about major health outcomes for 55 Community Statistical Areas in the city of Baltimore. Although this data is from 2017, it is still pretty recent data and is relevant because Baltimore has a long history of high homicide rates.
