# Background
Based on countless studies, homicide has been linked to factors such as poverty and economic inequality. Although the issue of homicides is not unique to any location, in 2019, there were [347 homicides in Baltimore](https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/31/americas/baltimore-2019-homicides/index.html), breaking the record for killings per capita. Since all cities across the nation have poverty and economic inequality, we wanted to analyze whether there are other significant variables more present in Baltimore that could lead to such a high homicide rate. This brings us to our business question:

What are the socioeconomic factors that affect Baltimore’s high homicide rate, and what actions can the local government take?

After researching more about Baltimore, we narrowed down our question:

Could food deserts be a cause of the high homicide rate in Baltimore?

## Data
We chose to analyze the [2017 Neighborhood Health Profile Data](https://health.baltimorecity.gov/neighborhoods/neighborhood-health-profile-reports) from the Baltimore City Health Department. It is comprehensive and contains data about major health outcomes for 55 Community Statistical Areas in the city of Baltimore. Although this data is from 2017, it is still relevant because Baltimore has a long history of high homicide rates. 

We looked at these factors: 
- Median household income
Median annual household income, according to the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance
- % living below Federal Poverty Level
Percentage of families that earned less than the Federal Poverty Level in the past 12 months
- % of Adults with Less than a HS Diploma
Percentage of adults 25 years of age or older with less than a high school diploma
- % of Area Covered by Food Desert
Percentage of land area covered by food desert, as defined by the Center for a Livable Future
- Vacant Lot Density
Number of vacant lots per 10,000 housing units
- Unemployment
Percentage of population 16 years of age or older in the labor force that are unemployed
