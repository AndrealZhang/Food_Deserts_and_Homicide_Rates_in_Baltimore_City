# The Impact of Food Deserts on Homicide Rates in Baltimore City
Homicide has been linked to factors such as poverty and economic inequality. In 2019, there were [347 homicides in Baltimore](https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/31/americas/baltimore-2019-homicides/index.html), breaking the record for killings per capita. We wanted to analyze whether there are other significant variables more present in Baltimore that could lead to such a high homicide rate.

What are the socioeconomic factors that affect Baltimore’s high homicide rate, and what actions can the local government take?

After researching more about specific conditions in Baltimore, we found that [20% of Baltimore residents live in food deserts](https://www.umaryland.edu/gogreen/news/food/combating-the-urban-food-desert.php). A food desert is roughly defined as a location where there is no access to affordable nutritious foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Since a high population of Baltimore residents live in food deserts, we narrowed down our question:

Could food deserts be a cause of the high homicide rate in Baltimore and how can policymakers use this information to combat homicide rates?

We analyzed several other factors, including more common factors such as unemployment, for comparison.

### Finding
Through our analysis, we found that in neighborhoods with a higher percentage of area covered by food desert, there was a higher percentage of deaths due to homicides. In areas of food deserts people are forced to eat more unhealthy foods because of issues such as accessibility and affordability; these unhealthy diets lead to more aggression and stress, ultimately linking to higher homicide rates. 

### Suggestion
The Baltimore City Government should promote programs that help citizens afford healthy foods so that they can afford to eat healthier, thereby reducing aggression and stress and resulting in fewer homicides.

# Significance
As mentioned earlier, homicides in Baltimore are a deadly problem that is getting worse every year. However, another problem goes undercovered: food deserts. As mentioned earlier, citizens in the food deserts cannot access healthy foods and are forced to consume more unhealthy food options at corner stores and carry out restaurants. Healthy diets are important because they help our bodies to [manage the psychological changes caused by stress](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/stress-diet-can-foods-help). On the other hand, [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/apr/24/can-food-make-you-angry) notes that greater trans fatty acids from unhealthy diets are associated with greater aggression and [ETIMES](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/diet/Junk-food-leads-to-anger-issues/articleshow/19946022.cms) corroborates that a nutrient deficiency leaves a person hyperactive towards a stressor. Thus, it is important to analyze the relationship between food deserts and homicide rates as if there are more food deserts, then there will be higher aggression caused by unhealthy diets, possibly leading to more homicides.

# Solution
The government should promote career development programs to help increase employment and increase citizens’ disposable income. Along with these policies, the government needs to promote healthy foods by offering incentives such as discounts. By doing so, healthy foods become more affordable, mitigating the negative impacts of food deserts and ultimately reducing the homicide rate. 

Reducing the negative consequences of food deserts is crucial to fighting Baltimore's high homicide rate. After analyzing several factors of interest from the [2017 Neighborhood Health Profile Data](https://health.baltimorecity.gov/neighborhoods/neighborhood-health-profile-reports) from the Baltimore City Health Department, it became clear that in areas with a higher percentage of food deserts, there were a high percentage of homicide rates.

As shown in this scatter plot, this upward sloping trend line represents that food deserts and homicides were positively correlated. In fact, around 36% of the percent of deaths due to homicides can be linked to food deserts. Although this number may seem small, it is important to remember that there are multiple factors that can impact homicide rates and one factor affecting around 36% of homicide rates is significant. 

The need for the government to implement more professional development programs in order to give citizens the opportunity for more income also stems from the positive relationship between unemployment and homicide rates.

The upward sloping trend line emphasizes the fact that the higher the unemployment, the higher the percent of deaths due to homicide rates. In fact, around 56% of the percent of deaths due to homicides can be linked to unemployment, making it crucial for the Baltimore City government to provide assistance. 

Thus, from this data, it is important to realize that food deserts impact homicide rates and that the best way to target the problem of food deserts is for policymakers to implement programs to increase affordability through job programs and discounts.

# Future Plan
Organizations are already helping with food deserts in Baltimore. For example, [Gittelsohn](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/01/23/baltimore-food-desert-policy-100121), an organization, has been promoting healthy foods and fresh fruits by working with carryout restaurants on menus and new recipes since 2005. However, Baltimore City needs more guidance that will lead to more healthier and fresher foods. Simply opening more grocery stores will be ineffective because people with little income will still be unable to afford these healthy foods. Along with organizations that are providing fresher food, there should be more government funded programs that will allow more citizens of Baltimore to consume more healthy foods. If the citizens earn more income, they will be able to afford healthier food. Thus, the government should promote career development programs that help citizens obtain jobs and incentive them to spend money on healthy food by providing discounts. If the government promotes programs that give citizens healthy foods at a cheaper price, citizens will eat healthier, reducing aggression and stress levels, and ultimately the homicide rate.
